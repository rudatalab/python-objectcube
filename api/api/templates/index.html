      Multi-dimensional Media Model, or M3, is a generic multi-dimensional analysis model for media files. The model is based on the concepts of multi-dimensional analysis (MDA) which have been successfully used in OLAP applications to view and analyze data. We have developed a prototype media server called O3 implementing the M3 model, for the purpose of demonstrating the efficiency of the model as well as for the future development of browsing interfaces based on the model; the server will be made publically available.
